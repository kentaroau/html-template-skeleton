## Installation

There are 3 options to install and build on top of this package. First, ensure that **node.js** & **npm** are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.

### Option 1 - use npx (prefered)

This is my prefered option when starting new HTML projects:

```
mkdir new-site
cd new-site
npx html-template-skeleton .
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Option 2 - use npm

```
npm install html-template-skeleton
```
Go to the html-template-skeleton folder and take out which files you need.

### Option 3 - use git clone

Clone the git repo with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentaroau/html-template-skeleton
```
Similar to option 2, just take out the files you need.
